  <h1>How it Works</h1>

  <section class="text-block">
    <h2>1. Your design – File upload</h2>
    <p>Our machines need to know where to cut, and where and how to bend, if required.</p>
    <p>The best file format is an AutoCAD drawing file (dwg, dwt, dxf, dws, dwf, dwfx, dxb). Most CAD packages can save your designs as an AutoCAD drawing sketch file. If your designs require bends, the position, angle and bend radius of the bends must be shown.</p>
    <p>If you don't know CAD, or if you can't produce an AutoCAD drawing file, get in touch. We can work with what you have, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A picture of what you need, with measurements</li>
      <li>A sketch of what you need, with measurements</li>
      <li>A different CAD format</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You also need to tell us what material you need. This includes the type of metal, the thickness, and the surface finish you require. If you are unsure, reach out to us – we can advise you on suitable choices for your application.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="text-block">
    <h2>2. Final design &amp; quote</h2>
    <p>We will send you a copy of the final design to approve, along with a quote. We will include an estimate of the date of delivery with the quote.</p>
    <p>At this point you need to approve the final design – if you have any questions or changes to the design, now is the time to make sure you are happy and that the part will satisfy your requirements.</p>
    <p>We may also present you with alternative designs that either / and:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make the part easier or possible to produce (e.g. some bends look feasible in CAD, but are not possible to bend in reality)</li>
      <li>Make the part cheaper to produce or assemble</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you approve the final design, you also need to approve the quote, which will include the cost of shipping. The quote depends on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The material chosen, including thickness and surface finish</li>
      <li>How much material is required, by weight</li>
      <li>The total length of laser cutting required – the total path of all the cuts required</li>
      <li>The number and types of bends required</li>
      <li>Tolerances required for cutting and bending – Refer to the Q &amp; A section for more information about our standard tolerances</li>
      <li>How much assistance you need to get to the final approved design</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you require specialised metals, thicknesses or surface finishes, or if you required different processes like stamping or punching, please reach out to see if we can help with what you need.</p>

    <h2>3. Payment</h2>
    <p>Once you approve the quote, we'll send you a link to our payment portal. You can pay using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Credit / Debit card</li>
      <li>Ozow (instant bank-to-bank transfer)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once payment has been verified, we will send you confirmation and start with the manufacture of your part.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="text-block">
    <h2>4. Manufacture and shipping</h2>
    <p>We will keep you informed about the progress in producing your part and will send you a tracking number as soon as it has shipped.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="text-block">
    <h2>5. Support and returns</h2>
    <p>You can reach out to us at any time if you have questions or need advice on using or assembling your part.</p>
    <p>If your part was damaged during shipping or if you are unhappy with what you received, please reach out to us.</p>
    <p>Generally, if the part is supplied as per the approved design and within agreed tolerance, we cannot be held responsible for whether it fulfils your requirements. We will always try to assist you, where possible, to alter the part, though you will be responsible for the cost of shipping and additional work.</p>
    <p>If we were at fault, we will ship you the correct part at no additional cost to you.</p>
