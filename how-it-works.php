    <p><?php echo "Our machines need to know where to cut, and where and how to bend, if required."; ?></p>
    <p><?php echo "The best file format is an AutoCAD drawing file (dwg, dwt, dxf, dws, dwf, dwfx, dxb). Most CAD packages can save your designs as an AutoCAD drawing sketch file. If your designs require bends, the position, angle and bend radius of the bends must be shown."; ?></p>
    <p><?php echo "If you don’t know CAD, or if you can’t produce an AutoCAD drawing file, get in touch. We can work with what you have, including:"; ?></p>

    </ul>
    <p><?php echo "You also need to tell us what material you need. This includes the type of metal, the thickness, and the surface finish you require. If you are unsure, reach out to us – we can advise you on suitable choices for your application."; ?></p>

    <h2><?php echo "2. Final design & quote"; ?></h2>
    <p><?php echo "We will send you a copy of the final design to approve, along with a quote. We will include an estimate of the date of delivery with the quote."; ?></p>
    <p><?php echo "At this point you need to approve the final design – if you have any questions or changes to the design, now is the time to make sure you are happy and that the part will satisfy your requirements."; ?></p>
    <p><?php echo "We may also present you with alternative designs that either / and:"; ?></p>
    <ul>
        <li><?php echo "Make the part easier or possible to produce (e.g. some bends look feasible in CAD, but are not possible to bend in reality)"; ?></li>
        <li><?php echo "Make the part cheaper to produce or assemble"; ?></li>
    </ul>
    <p><?php echo "Once you approve the final design, you also need to approve the quote, which will include the cost of shipping. The quote depends on:"; ?></p>

    </ul>
    <p><?php echo "If you require specialised metals, thicknesses or surface finishes, or if you required different processes like stamping or punching, please reach out to see if we can help with what you need."; ?></p>

    <p><?php echo "If your part was damaged during shipping or if you are unhappy with what you received, please reach out to us."; ?></p>
    <p><?php echo "Generally, if the part is supplied as per the approved design and within agreed tolerance, we cannot be held responsible for whether it fulfils your requirements. We will always try to assist you, where possible, to alter the part, though you will be responsible for the cost of shipping and additional work."; ?></p>
