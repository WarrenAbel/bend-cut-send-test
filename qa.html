  <h1>Q &amp; A</h1>

  <section class="qa-item">
    <h2>What are your tolerances?</h2>
    <p><strong>Cutting</strong> is normally within <strong>0.25mm</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Bending</strong> has many influences – we normally work on <strong>+/- 1mm</strong>. Critical bending tolerance needs to be communicated.</p>

    <h3>Key Bending Parameters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Minimum Bend Radius:</strong> This is the smallest possible radius for a bend without the material cracking or deforming undesirably.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Soft materials</strong> like aluminium and mild steel: minimum bend radius is often <strong>1×</strong> the material thickness.</li>
          <li><strong>Harder materials</strong> like the other metals listed: a radius of <strong>≥ 2×</strong> the material thickness is generally required to prevent cracking.</li>
          <li><strong>General rule:</strong> For materials between <strong>2–6 mm</strong> thick, a radius of <strong>1×</strong> thickness is often acceptable; for thicker materials, <strong>2–3×</strong> is recommended.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Minimum Flange Length:</strong> This is the shortest possible length of material that can be successfully bent on a die.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>General rule:</strong> Minimum flange length of <strong>4×</strong> the material thickness or <strong>12mm</strong>, whichever is greater.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Z-Bends:</strong> Maintain a specific minimum <em>X-measurement</em> (distance from the bend to the edge) to prevent tool collisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Feature Spacing:</strong> Features like holes or other bends need to be placed a sufficient distance from bend lines.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>General rule:</strong> Keep features at least <strong>4×</strong> the material thickness away from bend lines to avoid issues during manufacturing.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Curls:</strong> For more complex curls, the spacing from other features should be a minimum of the curl radius plus the sheet metal thickness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tolerances</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bend Angle Tolerance:</strong> ±1°</li>
      <li><strong>Length Tolerance:</strong> ±0.20mm (0.010 inches) per bend</li>
      <li><strong>ISO 2768:</strong> Widely recognized reference for general tolerances in precision sheet metal manufacturing (linear, angular, geometric).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="qa-item">
    <h2>Do you have tips for effective bending?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Avoid acute angles:</strong> Do not design for angles sharper than <strong>130°</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid extreme obtuse angles:</strong> Do not design for angles greater than <strong>175°</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Be mindful of successive bends:</strong> Place bends as far apart as possible; successive bends can be difficult to fit on the die and complicate manufacturing.</li>
      <li><strong>Consider material hardness:</strong> The specific material and its yield strength are crucial factors for bend radii and feasibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What metals do you offer?</h2>
    <p>If you need something not in this list, please reach out to us.</p>

    <h3>Mild Steel</h3>
    <p>Mild steel (low-carbon steel) contains ~0.05%–0.25% carbon. Its low carbon content makes it ductile, malleable, and easy to work with—widely used in construction, manufacturing, and fabrication.</p>

    <h3>3CR12 Stainless Steel</h3>
    <p>3CR12 is a corrosion-resistant utility ferritic stainless steel developed in South Africa by Columbus Stainless. It bridges the gap between carbon/mild steel and more expensive austenitic grades (like 304 and 316), offering a balance of corrosion resistance, strength, and cost-effectiveness.</p>

    <h3>430 Stainless Steel</h3>
    <p>430 is a straight-chromium ferritic stainless steel (~16–18% chromium, little to no nickel). It’s widely used for its good corrosion resistance, formability, and affordability compared to austenitic grades like 304.</p>

    <h3>304 Stainless Steel</h3>
    <p>The most widely used stainless grade (austenitic). Excellent corrosion resistance, durability, and formability; often called the “workhorse” of stainless steels.</p>

    <h3>316 Stainless Steel</h3>
    <p>A premium austenitic stainless steel with exceptional corrosion resistance, especially in harsh and chloride-rich environments (often called “marine grade stainless”). Performs better than 304 in seawater and de-icing salts.</p>

    <h3>Aluminium 1050</h3>
    <p>Commercially pure aluminium (≥99.5%). Excellent corrosion resistance, high ductility, and very good thermal/electrical conductivity. Non-heat-treatable; strength is via cold working (work hardening).</p>

    <h2>How do I design a part?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Refer to the <a href="how-it-works.html">How it works</a> section for guiding comments.</li>
      <li>Have an idea of the shape and size. If it must fit into a space or assembly, measure carefully.</li>
      <li>If you can’t produce a CAD model, send a picture or drawing with <strong>critical dimensions</strong> and intended <strong>material thickness</strong>.</li>
      <li>If you need help to get to a design that solves your problem, please get in touch.</li>
      <li>If you like to iterate yourself, consider learning <strong>CAD</strong>. There are free and paid packages (online and installable) with different workflows.</li>
      <li>We prefer online tools for easy collaboration and lower hardware requirements.</li>
      <li>Choose a tool with good online support and community forums.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How do returns work?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Refer to the <a href="how-it-works.html">How it works</a> section for more detail.</li>
      <li>Because we provide custom parts made to order, we can’t accept returns if the part matches the <strong>approved design</strong> and is within <strong>tolerance</strong>.</li>
      <li>If we made a mistake, we’ll send a replacement part at no additional cost to you.</li>
    </ul>
